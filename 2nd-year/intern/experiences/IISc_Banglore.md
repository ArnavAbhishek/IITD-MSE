- Research Intern @ *IISc, Bangalore, Centre of Excellence in High Temperature Materials Research(CoE-HTMR)*
- Topic *Strain field dtermination using UV-DIC at ultra-high temperatures*
- Professor **Prof. Praveen Kumar**

### Experience
The experience was really rewarding for me. I personally am very inclined towards future prospects in materials science and engineering so this internship really unlocked domains of intrest in my mind accelerating my goals. My thesis report was titled **"Development of UV-DIC Technique for Capturing Deformations during Rapid Heating and Extreme Thermal Conditions"** whcih involved me working and learning in lab for 6 days a week for 2 months. 

My work started off with literature review of concepts and practices associated with Digital Image Correlation(DIC) followed by some practice on experimental data using Vic-2D DIC software. The latter half was devoted to two experiments:
- Delamination of TBC coating on Haynes Ni alloy due to rapid thermal cycling with 2kW laser source. Aim to determine strain field at interface during delamination
- Isothermal high temperature(1300-1500C) tensile testing of Carbon reinforced Silicon Carbide(CfSiC) composites. Aim to determine strain maps of deformation

The laboratory expereince was entirely hands on with sitting on about for hours polishing the Ni alloy sample and using the Low-Speed saw for cutting specimen to appropriate sizes. I am glad to have made a lot of mistakes to gain the best experience out of it....
I additionally completed two side-quests in these two months: One being a visit to National Aeronautics Laboratory(NAL) and other attending the Electron Microscopy Conference(EMSI 2025). 

Being from Bangalore itself, accomodation was never an issue as I was commuting daily from home in packed BMTC buses. IISc Campus is really green (like really) and huge. The first step on campus will totally give out research and knowledge vibes and the main building just leaks too much aura.

### How did you get your intern ?
Well I actually approached Prof Lakshmi Narayanan in our dept here since his field of mechanical behviour of materials resonated with my interests. I asked him about contacts at IISc where he can sort of provide a referral for a research intern. Hence upon his recommendation i approahed Prof. Praveen Kuamr at IISc thorugh iitd webmail for an internship.
The professor there doesnt usually take interns but since I came to him via a referral and obviosuly the brand name of IITD , he allowed me to work in his lab. Although yes there was no stipend nor accomodation but it didnt matter to me much.

### Tips
I started mailing very late, beginning in Feb-Mar 2023. I would suggest you must statrt mailing really early if you are aiming for a foreign intern. 

Moral : It is not the easiest of jobs and you do need to spend some time and effort on finding an intern. Although at IISC it is comparatively easier than a foreign intern. Use the brand name thoroughly it does creates a difference. 

NOTE: Do not miss out on SRFP Programme at IISc. I got to know about it after reaching IISc. SFRP gives stipend for your internship.

Also try to apply early so that you have the time left to discuss the accomodation and expenses involved.

- Topic: **Machine Learning and Finite Element Analysis**
- Professor: **Prof. Suchandrima Das**

### Experience
It was my first time staying away from home (for two months), since I am from Delhi, the separation didn’t feel that big coming to IIT. Booking accommodation and food was not very challenging, but yes, it required some time.

Coming to the technical part, my project was on "Automating hyperparameter tuning in Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Modelling using Machine Learning." Honestly, I didn’t quite understand what this meant at first—but that’s the objective of a research internship, you experience the entire process, starting from literature review and ending with the final project. Click [here](https://github.com/ArnavAbhishek/CPFE-Parameter-Tuning) to see my project codes.

My project mainly required a basic understanding of Finite Element Analysis (APL104) and a brief overview of Mechanical Behaviour (MLL100). Apart from that, it was mostly logic building, algorithmic designing, and some bits of ML. I had to define an optimization algorithm to form a closed feedback loop to minimize the losses between experimental and simulated data from a Nano-Indentation experiment. I spent around 5-6 days reading papers on similar optimizations, doing RnD, and then it was mostly writing and debugging code. The project was fairly straightforward if you know basic OOPs and DSA, if not, then just basic Python programming would suffice, alongside using ChatGPT and Claude (my life savior).

My PhD supervisors were also quite new to this type of work, so I was mostly on my own. I got exposure to working with multiple people and also got to know about my co-interns’ experiences in molecular dynamics and DFT simulations as well. 

Brownie point: Try searching for a professor with atleast 3-4 years of experience in the same college, as it would help you to socialize with the research group much better, and you won't feel left out. In my case, my professor shifted to IISc around 7 months before my intern and she was the newest in the department with a very small research group, leading me to be mostly separated from the group. I somewhat got lucky beacuse I was accompanied by some of my co-interns from other labs, which might not be the case for you. So choose wisely.

I also attended various seminars while at IISc, including one by Nobel Laureate Brian Schmidt and another by Philip Eisenlohr from Michigan State University. I explored Bangalore, Mysore, and Lepakshi as well. The Mysore trip was the highlight of my research intern.

### How did you get your intern?
Through cold mailing. I approached around five professors from IISc and, except one, everyone else replied, three with positive responses, from whom I had to choose.

### OCS intern preparations
Towards the end of the research intern, I started devoting most of my time to OCS intern prep, doing CP, revising DSA, making projects, and solving interview-type LeetCode questions. Actually, I wrapped up my research project within one month, and it was production-ready, so I was mostly free in the second month. This was a crucial period, the time when the CV window opens and research interns get over. You must try to maximize your productivity during this time.

### Personal Story
I started cold mailing around November, targeting only the top 30 QS-ranked colleges, which didn’t turn out to be a good decision. Even though I got offers from UC Berkeley and Max Planck Institute for online internships, I was very adamant about working on-site, so I continued mailing.

I had accepted the online offer from UCB, but (un)luckily, the professor backed out at the end of January (after four Zoom meetings that were at 5 a.m., thanks to the PST–IST time difference). After that, the semester gained momentum, and my mailing efficiency dropped. I resumed mailing around March, targeting IISc and some QS >100 colleges.

The mistake I made was starting late. Initially, I wanted to secure an internship in core computational materials and probabilistic modelling; however, I didn’t get any replies. Then I expanded my search to professors working in any domain of machine learning. Interestingly, I got an offer within one week of starting this new search, and all three positive replies came during this week.

Moral of the story: Going to IISc is not at all difficult for those with the IITD tag, but to aim for a good foreign research internship, you should start mailing early.

Another reason to apply early is that you’ll have sufficient time to discuss accommodation and expenses involved.
