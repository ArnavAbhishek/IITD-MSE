- Research Intern @ *IISc, Bangalore, Centre of Excellence in High Temperature Materials Research(CoE-HTMR)*
- Topic *Strain field dtermination using UV-DIC at ultra-high temperatures*
- Professor *Prof. Praveen Kumar*

### Experience
The experience was really rewarding for me. I personally am very inclined towards future prospects in materials science and engineering so this internship really unlocked domains of intrest in my mind accelerating my goals. My thesis report was titled ###"Development of UV-DIC Technique for Capturing Deformations during Rapid Heating and Extreme Thermal Conditions"### whcih involved me working and learning in lab for 6 days a week for 2 months. 

My work started off with literature review of concepts and practices associated with Digital Image Correlation(DIC) followed by some practice on experimental data using Vic-2D DIC software. The latter half was devoted to two experiments:
- Delamination of TBC coating on Haynes Ni alloy due to rapid thermal cycling with 2kW laser source. Aim to determine strain field at interface during delamination
- Isothermal high temperature(1300-1500C) tensile testing of Carbon reinforced Silicon Carbide(CfSiC) composites. Aim to determine strain maps of deformation

The laboratory expereince was entirely hands on with sitting on about for hours polishing the Ni alloy sample and using the Low-Speed saw for cutting specimen to appropriate sizes. I am glad to have made a lot of mistakes to gain the best experience out of it....
I additionally completed two side-quests in these two months: One being a visit to National Aeronautics Laboratory(NAL) and other attending the Electron Microscopy Conference(EMSI 2025). 

Being from Bangalore itself, accomodation was never an issue as I was commuting daily from home in packed BMTC buses. IISc Campus is really green (like really) and huge. The first step on campus will totally give out research and knowledge vibes and the main building just leaks too much aura.

### How did you get your intern ?
IISc's departmental websites to search for professors and their About page/ Bio to get the research topic for intern :)

### Tips
I started mailing very late, beginning in April end 2023 (just before 4th semester Majors). Also, I lacked a passport at that point, so I reached out exclusively to professors at IISc. Initially, I wanted to secure an internship in  probability or cryptography; however, I didn't got any reply. Then, I expanded my search to professors woking in machine learning. Interestingly, I reached out to just two professors, and remarkably, both of them extended offers for the internship.

Moral : It is easiest to get an intern in ML domain because most professors in circuital domain are working on it. 

Also try to apply early so that you have the time left to discuss the accomodation and expenses involved.
